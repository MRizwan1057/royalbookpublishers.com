                            book to showcase their expertise, but they need more time and motivation. Especially when
                            compared to something like a children’s book, writing a children's book is not as easy as it
                            looks. No surprise there; if it was simple, everyone would be a children's book ghostwriter.
                            Although kids’ psyche is simple to comprehend, stories that resonate with their IQ can be
                            challenging to pen. It's not enough to just use age-appropriate vocabulary when writing for
                            children; you also need to include statements that fuel their brain development. </p>
