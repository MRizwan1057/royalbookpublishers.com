                        <p>Yes, if you're an author, you should engage a book marketing. Writing a book and advertising
                            are two completely different things. If someone is great at writing a book, they may not be
                            so good at advertising it, and vice versa. As a result, it is a good idea to engage a
                            professional to handle your marketing and promotional operations. Professional book
                            marketers have established relationships with the publishing sectors, which might take years
                            to cultivate. The marketer's expertise and credentials will enable them to execute plans
                            that result in maximum and efficient advantages, which is a better alternative than you
                            doing fresh trials and squandering your valuable time and efforts. </p>
